All code was written for R. 
  
  
  **ABSCode/:** All of the code written to produce the figures used in the manuscript 
  
  **data/:** Datasets used in the project
  
  **figures/:** JPEGs of the figures used in the manuscript

Please contact cmw277@georgetown.edu with any questions about code. As we describe in the limitations section of the manuscript, this data collection for this project required a comprehensive, publicly-available and 
accurate repository of national level policy on ABS. Thus, our results may be biased against countries that do not have a robust, open-source digital legal database. For any questions about methodology or the data included in this repo,
please contact the corresponding author at Rebecca.Katz@georgetown.edu.
